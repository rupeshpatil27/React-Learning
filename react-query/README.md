## ✅ Concepts Covered

### 📦 Basics

- ✅ Setup and configuration of React Query
- ✅ useQuery for fetching data
- ✅ Exploring useQuery properties (data, error, status, isFetching, etc.)
- ✅ React Query DevTools integration
- ✅ Using `staleTime`, `cacheTime`, and `refetchOnWindowFocus`
- ✅ Manual query execution using `enabled: false`

---

### 🔁 Query Patterns

- ✅ Dynamic parallel queries using `useQueries`
- ✅ Manual parallel queries
- ✅ Dependent queries (chained queries based on results)
- ✅ Polling with `refetchInterval`
- ✅ Query disabling and pausing

---

### 🔄 Mutations

- ✅ Creating, updating, and deleting data using `useMutation`
